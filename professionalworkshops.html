            <p id = 'prologue'>Some of the benefits you mentioned regarding the release of personal hardships, and increasing the status of personal relationships stuck with me. In times of need, sometimes the only solution that I find for myself turning to is journaling. The entire process can be relaxing and take your mind off whatever may be troubling you. Additionally, self-expression can be difficult, especially around others where there may be external social or emotional pressure. Using a journal to express yourself, even if only your eyes will see it, alleviates any anxiety that may be present. The strategy that you presented in terms of the “WRITE” is a fantastic way of reminding.</p>
